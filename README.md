# Compiler Design Course Project 📚💻

This project is a part of the Compiler Design course and focuses on implementing various components of a compiler. 🛠️ The main features of this project include:

## Lexical Analysis ✨
- `lexer.py`: Takes a `.yal` file as input, which contains the lexing specification. It constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) based on the tokens defined using regular expressions. 🔍
- `scan.py`: Utilizes the DFA generated by `lexer.py` to scan an input file and produce a sequence of tokens. 🎉

## Syntax Analysis 🔧
- `syntax.py`: Reads a `.yalp` file, which contains the grammar specification for the language. 📜
- `parse.py`: Implements an SLR(1) parser. It takes the tokens produced by the lexer as input and parses them according to the grammar defined in the `.yalp` file. 🔍

The lexical analysis phase converts the source code into a stream of tokens, while the syntax analysis phase checks the structure of the code against the defined grammar rules. 🔗

## Usage 🚀
1. Define the lexing specification in a `.yal` file. ✏️
2. Specify the grammar rules in a `.yalp` file. 📝
3. Run `lexer.py` with the `.yal` file to generate the DFA for tokenization. ⚙️
4. Use `scan.py` to tokenize an input file using the generated DFA. 🔍
5. Run `syntax.py` with the `.yalp` file to read the grammar specification. 📖
6. Use `parse.py` to parse the tokens produced by the lexer using the SLR(1) parsing algorithm. 🔧

This project provides a basic implementation of a compiler's front-end, covering lexical analysis and syntax analysis using SLR(1) parsing. 🎓
